        <p>
            The government has signed deals with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank to get Covid-19 vaccine shots
            quickly, Meerjady Sabrina Flora, additional director general of DGHS, said.
        </p>
        <p>
            The World Bank has agreed to provide $500 million to Bangladesh in additional financing to buy the Covid-19
            vaccine shots, while ADB has agreed to give $940 million, she said on Wednesday at a virtual press
            conference from the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS).
        </p>
        <p>
            The $500 million World Bank loan for buying vaccine shots under the "Covid-19 Emergency Response and
            Pandemic Preparedness Project" will help Bangladesh vaccinate about 54 million people, the multinational
            lender said on Wednesday.
        </p>
        <p>
            COVAX now has agreements in place to access nearly 2 billion doses of several promising vaccine candidates
            and laid the groundwork for further doses to be secured through contributions from donors, the World Health
            Organization (WHO) said on 18 December 2020.

        <p>
            The government of Bangladesh signed three financing agreements totaling $1.04 billion with the World Bank to
            respond to the Covid-19 pandemic and to build resilience to future crises, including vaccination against
            Covid-19, expand electronic procurement and accelerate economic recovery, reports BSS.
        </p>
        <p>
            The $500 million additional financing to the Covid-19 Emergency Response and Pandemic Preparedness Project
            will help Bangladesh vaccinate about 54 million people against Covid-19. It will help the government procure
            vaccines; expand storage facilities; and distribute and deploy the vaccines, said a World Bank press release
            on Wednesday.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project will also continue to provide support to strengthen the national health systems to detect,
            prevent, and treat Covid-19 cases as well for preparedness for future health emergencies.
        </p>
        <p>
            “These financings will help Bangladesh provide vaccination to mass people and thus help the economy to turn
            around and remain resilient,” said Fatima Yasmin, secretary of the Economic Relations Division.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mercy Tembon, World Bank country director for Bangladesh and Bhutan said, “The Covid-19 pandemic continues
            to be an enormous challenge around the world.” She said so far, Bangladesh has tackled the challenges well
            through fiscal stimulus and social protection programs. “However economic recovery would depend on
            vaccination for those who need it most, and actions to increase efficiency and boost productivity,”
        </p>
        <p>
            Mercy also said, “These projects will help vaccinate about one-third of the population, attract direct
            private investment in specialized economic zones and expand as well as upgrade the electronic government
            procurement system.” The $500 million Private Investment and Digital Entrepreneurship (PRIDE) Project will
            promote and attract about $2 billion direct private investments and strengthen social and environmental
            standards in selected public and private economic zones and software technology parks.It will develop the
            Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Shilpa Nagar II in Mirsarai-Feni and establish Dhaka’s first digital
            entrepreneurship hub in the Janata Software Technology Park and turn it into a green building.By creating
            more jobs and attracting domestic and foreign private investment, including in the IT and ITES sectors, the
            project will help the economy to rebound from the impact of Covid-19.
        </p>
        <p>
            The $40 million Additional Financing to the Digitizing Implementation Monitoring and Public Procurement
            Project (DIMAPP) will help Bangladesh expand electronic government procurement (e-GP) to all public
            procurement entities with new features to respond to the Covid-19 challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            Last year, during the general holiday for the Covid-19 pandemic, e-GP played a critical role in continuing
            development works throughout the country.

            To respond to the challenges of Covid-19 pandemic and any other future emergencies, the financing will help
            add features to the e-GP system, including international bidding, direct contracting, framework agreement,
            electronic contract management and payment, procurement data analytics, geo-tagging, and others. The
            agreements were signed by Fatima Yasmin and Mercy Tembon on behalf of the government and the World Bank,
            respectively.

            The credits are from the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA), and have a 30-year term,
            including a five-year grace period. Bangladesh currently has the largest ongoing IDA program totaling over
            $14 billion.

            The World Bank was among the first development partners to support Bangladesh and has committed more than
            $35 billion in grants, interest-free, and concessional credits to the country since its Independence.
        </p>
        <h3> <u> World Bank Group Covid-19 Response </u></h3>
        <p>
            The World Bank, one of the largest sources of funding and knowledge for developing countries, is taking
            broad, fast action to help developing countries respond to the health, social and economic impacts of
            Covid-19.
        </p>
        <p>
            This includes $12 billion to help low and middle-income countries purchase and distribute Covid-19 vaccines,
            tests, and treatments, and strengthen vaccination systems. The financing builds on the broader World Bank
            Group Covid-19 response, which is helping more than 100 countries strengthen health systems, support the
            poorest households, and create supportive conditions to maintain livelihoods and jobs for those hit hardest.

        </div>


        <p>
            Captain Rishabh Pant won the battle of wicketkeepers as Delhi Capitals trumped the Mahendra Singh
            Dhoni-led Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League on Saturday.
            Delhi rode on a 138-run opening stand between Shikhar Dhawan (85) and Prithvi Shaw (72) to chase down
            their target of 189 with eight balls and seven wickets to spare in Mumbai.The 14th edition of the
            popular Twenty20 tournament is being played behind closed doors with the country
            witnessing a surge in the Covid pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 23-year-old Pant, who was once an understudy to Dhoni and has now cemented his role as India's
            premier wicketkeeper, hit the winning runs in his first outing as T20 captain."It was good, once you win
            the match everything is good," Pant said after the win."In the middle, I was under pressure, but good
            job from Avesh (Khan) and the bowlers."On walking out to toss with Dhoni, Pant said, "Actually, it was
            special for me captaining in the IPL and toss with MS. I have learnt from him and he's my go-to man.
            Good feeling"Returning Chennai batsman Suresh Raina, who left the team due to personal reasons ahead of
            last year's edition in the United Arab Emirates, top-scored with 54 as Chennai posted 188-7 after being
            put into bat first.Dhoni was bowled for a second-ball duck but England players Moeen Ali (36) and Sam
            Curran (34) contributed with the bat for three-time champions Chennai.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fast bowlers Chris Woakes and Avesh Khan claimed two wickets each. The 21-year-old Shaw, likened to
            Indian batting great Sachin Tendulkar, exploded for last year's runners-up Delhi to extend his red hot
            form.Shaw, who made 72, recently topped the batting chart in India's 50-over domestic competition with
            827 runs in 8 matches for winners Mumbai. Shaw, who survived two dropped catches, finally fell to Dwayne
            Bravo after hitting nine fours and three sixes in his 38-ball blitz.
            Dhawan departed after smashing 10 boundaries and two over the fence hits in his 54-ball knock.Pant, who
            was named captain after regular skipper Shreyas Iyer was ruled out of this IPL season with a shoulder
            injury, hit an unbeaten 15."He kept his calm and will only get better with time," man of the match
            Dhawan said of his young captain.
